##Simpler

This is simply me messing around trying to make a framework that is a mix between react and angular. 
You can clone it and see what exactly it does. I was attempting to get two way data binding working.
It kind of works, you'll see what I mean if you clone the repo. I am attempting to see how hard it is 
to accomplish what angular and react do on my own. The next step here would be to implement some 
sort of DOM diffing.
